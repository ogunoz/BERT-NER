A O
2012 O

Removal B-TERM

enhanced O
by O
the O
addition O
of O

The O
main B-TERM
action O
of O
soaps O
and O
detergents O
is O
to O
reduce O
barriers O
to O
solution O
, O
and O
increase O
solubility O
. O

Water O
alone O
is O
an O
inefficient O
skin O

because O
fats O

, O
which O

, O
because O
of O
its O

A O

number B-TERM
of O
studies B-TERM
which O
have O
looked O
at O
the O

The O

" O
liquid O

" O

Antibacterial O

have O
been O
heavily O
promoted O
to O
a O
health O

To O
date O
, O
there O
is O
no O

that O
using O

. O

However O
, O
antibacterial O
soaps O
contain O
common O
antibacterial O
agents O
such O
as O
triclosan O
, O
which O
has O
an O
extensive O
list O
of O

So O
, O
even O
if O
antibiotic O

they O

It O
is O
for O
this O

Alcohol O
- O
free O

heavily O
dependent O
on O

unlike O
alcohol O
, O
which O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
decrease O

after O

, O
probably O
due O
to O
progressive O
adverse O

. O

Many O
people O
in O
low O

cannot O
afford O
soap O

. O

Ash O

may O
be O
more O

may O
be O
less O

One O
concern O
is O
that O
if O
the O

it O
may O
increase O
the O

it O
. O

Like B-TERM
soap O
, O
ash O
is O
also O
a O
disinfecting O
agent O
because O
in O

However O
, O
low O

rather O
can O
also B-TERM
be O
the O
result O
of O

The O

For O

A O

The O
phrase O
" O
washing O
one O
's O
hands O
of O
" O
something O
, O
means B-TERM
declaring O
one O
's O
unwillingness O
to O
take B-TERM
responsibility O
for O
the O
thing O
or O
share O
complicity O
in O
it O
. O

It O
originates O
from O
the O
bible O
passage O
in O
Matthew O
where O
Pontius O
Pilate O
washed O
his O
hands O
of O
the O
decision B-TERM
to O
crucify O
Jesus O

, O
but O
has O
become O
a O
phrase O
with O
a O
much O
wider O
usage O
in O
some O
English O
communities O
. O

In O
Shakespeare O
's O
Macbeth O
, O
Lady B-TERM
Macbeth O
begins O
to O
compulsively O
wash O
her O
hands O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
cleanse O
an O
imagined O

, O
representing O
her O
guilty O
conscience O
regarding O
crimes B-TERM
she O
had O
committed O
and O
induced O
her O
husband B-TERM

commit O
. O

It O
has O
also B-TERM
been O
found O
that O
people O
, O
after O

recalled O

tend O

hands O
more O
often B-TERM

, O
and O
tend O
to O
value O

. O

Furthermore O
, O
those O
who O
are O
allowed O
to O
wash O
their O

after O
such O

are O
less O

that O
caused B-TERM
an O

This O

in O
the O

area B-TERM
. O

Whenever O
possible O
, O
we O
will O
try O
to O
compare O
COVID O

, O
Middle O
East O

. O

We O
will O
also B-TERM
discuss O
what O
we O
have O
learned O
so O
far O
regarding O
the O
prevention O
and O
prognosis O
of O
the O

as O
well O
as O
some O
remaining O
yet O
urgent O
questions O
. O

CoVs O
have O
been O
traditionally O
considered O
nonlethal O
pathogens O
to O
humans O
, O
mainly O
causing B-TERM
approximately B-TERM
15 O
% O
of O
common B-TERM

4 O
. O

However O
, O
in O
this O
century B-TERM
, O
we O
have O
encountered O
highly O
pathogenic O
human O
CoVs O
twice O
, O
i.e. O
, O
SARS O

CoV O
and O
MERS O
- O
CoV O
, O
which O
caused B-TERM
an O
outbreak O
originally B-TERM
in O
China O
in O
2003 O
and O
Saudi O

in O
2012 O
, O
respectively O
, O
and O
soon B-TERM
spread O
to O
many O
other O
countries O
with O
horrible O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
current O
COVID O
- O
19 O
is O
the O
third O
CoV O
outbreak O
in O
the O

A O

On O

the O

Due O

the O

Even O

Pharmaceutical O

The O

Plasma O

generation O

The O
collection O
of O
the O

from O
patients B-TERM
who O
recovered O
from O
a O
contagious O
disease B-TERM
to O
treat O
other O
patients B-TERM
suffering O
from O
the O
same O
disease B-TERM
or O
to O
protect O
healthy O
individuals O
from O
catching O
the O
disease O
has O
a O
long O
history O
. O

Indeed O
, O
recovered O
patients B-TERM
often B-TERM
have O
a O
relatively O
high O
level O
of O
antibodies O
against O
the O
pathogen O
in O
their O
blood B-TERM
. O

Antibodies O
are O
an O
immunoglobulin O
( O
Ig O
) O
produced O
by O
B O
lymphocytes O
to O
fight O
pathogens O
and O
other O
foreign O
objects B-TERM
and O
they O
recognize O
unique O
molecules O
in O
the O
pathogens O
and O
neutralize O
them O
directly O
. O

Based O
on O
this O
, O
plasma O
was O
collected O
from O
the O
blood O
of O
a O
group O
of O
patients B-TERM
who O
recovered O
from O
COVID O

19 O
and O
was O
injected O
into O
10 O
seriously O
ill O
patients B-TERM

Their O
symptoms O
improved O
within O
24 O
hours O
, O
accompanied O
by O
reduced O
inflammation O
and O
viral O
loads O
and O
improved O
oxygen O
saturation O
in O
the O
blood B-TERM
. O

However O
, O
verification O
and O
clarification O
are O
necessary O
to O
propose O
the O
method B-TERM
for O
large O
- O
scale O
use B-TERM
before O
specific O
therapies O
are O
not O
yet O
developed O
. O

In O
addition B-TERM
, O
given O
the O
therapeutic O
effects O
, O
some O
disadvantages O
associated O
with O
the O
plasma O
should O
be O
considered O
carefully O
. O

For O
example O
, O
antibodies O
can O
overstimulate O
the O
immune O
response O
and O
cause B-TERM
cytokine O
release O
syndrome O
, O
which O
is O
potentially O
a O
life O
- O
threatening O
toxicity O
. O

The O
concentration O
of O
antibodies O
in O
the O
blood B-TERM
is O
usually O
low O
, O
and O
the O
demand O
for O
the O
plasma O
is O
large O
to O
treat O
critically O
ill O
patients B-TERM
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
develop O
and O
produce B-TERM
specific O
antibodies O
rapidly O
enough B-TERM
to O
fight O
against O
a O
global O
epidemic O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
more O
critical O
and O
practical O
to O
isolate O
B O
cells O
from O
recovered O
patients B-TERM
and O
identify O
the O
genetic O
codes O
encoding O
effective O
antibodies O
or O
screen O
for O
effective O
antibodies O
against O
essential O
proteins B-TERM
of O
the O
virus O
. O

This O
way O
, O
we O
can O
readily O
scale O
up O
the O
production O
of O
the O
antibodies O
. O

TCM O
has O
been O
used B-TERM
to O
treat O
a O
variety O
of O
diseases B-TERM
in O
China O
for O
thousands O
of O
years O
. O

However O
, O
its O
effects O
largely O
rely O
on O
a O
combination B-TERM
of O
multiple O
components B-TERM
in O
a O
formula B-TERM
that O
varies O
depending O
on O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
a O
disease B-TERM
based O
on O
the O
theories O
of O
TCM O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
effective B-TERM
components B-TERM
remain O
unknown B-TERM
or O
are O
vague O
as O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
extract O
and O
verify O
such O
components O
or O
their O
optimal O
combinations B-TERM
. O

Currently O
, O
due O
to O
the O
lack B-TERM
of O
effective B-TERM
and O
specific O
therapy O
for O
COVID O
- O
19 O
, O
TCM O
has O
become O
one O
of O
the O
major O
alternative O
treatments O
for O
patients B-TERM
with O
light O
to O
moderate O
symptoms O
or O
for O
those O
who O
have O
recovered O
from O
severe O
stages B-TERM
. O

For O
example O
, O
Shu O
Feng O
Jie O
Du O
capsules O
and O
Lian O
Hua O
Qing O
Wen O
capsules O
were O
found O
to O
be O
effective B-TERM
for O
COVID O

19 O
treatment O
. O

Top O

rates O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
COVID O

19 O
patients B-TERM
were O
observed O
in O
several O
provinces O
in O
China O
that O
used O
TCM O
in O
87 O
% O
of O
their O
patients B-TERM
, O
including O
Gansu O
( O

used O
TCM O
in O
only O
approximately O
30 O
% O
of O
its O
COVID O

19 O
patients B-TERM
, O
had O
the O
lowest O
cure O
rate O
( O
13 O
% O
) O
. O

However O
, O
this O
is O
quite B-TERM
a O
rough O
comparison O
as O
many O
other O
impact B-TERM
factors O
such O
as O
the O
number B-TERM

the O

should O
be O
included O
in O
the O
evaluation O
. O

On O
February O
18 O
, O
2020 O
, O
Boli O
Zhang O

published B-TERM
a O

compare O
western O
medicine O
( O
WM O

treatment O
alone O
with O
combined O
treatment O
of O
WM O

. O

They O
found O
that O
the O
times O
needed O
for O
body O
temperature O
recovery O
, O
symptom O
disappearance O
, O
and O
hospitalization O
were O
remarkably O
shorter O
in O
the O
WM O

TCM O
group O

in O
the O
WM O
only O
group O
. O

Most O
impressively O
, O
the O
rate O
for O
symptomatic O
worsening O
( O
from O
light O

severe O
) O
was O
remarkably O
lower O
for O
the O
WM O
+ O
TCM O
group O
than O
for O
the O
WM O
only O
group O
( O
7.4 O
% O
versus O
46.2 O
% O
) O
and O
the O
mortality O
was O
lower O
in O
the O
WM O
+ O
TCM O
group O
than O
WM O
only O
group O
( O
8.8 O
% O
versus O
39 O
% O
) O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
efficacy O
and O
safety O
of O
TCM O
still O
await O
more O
well O
- O
controlled O
trials O
at O
larger O
scales O
and O
in O
more O
centers O
. O

It O
would O
also B-TERM
be O
intriguing O
to O
characterize O
the O
mechanism O
of O
actions O
and O
clarify O
the O
effective O
components B-TERM
of O
TCM O
treatments O
or O
their O
combinations B-TERM
if O
possible O
. O

Patients B-TERM
with O
suspected O
or O
confirmed O
COVID O

19 O
mostly B-TERM
experience O
great O
fear B-TERM
of O
the O
highly O

even O

disease B-TERM
, O
and O
quarantined O

also B-TERM
experience O
boredom O

Furthermore O
, O
symptoms O

the O
infection O
such O

cough O
as O
well O
as O
adverse O
effects O
of O
the O
treatments O
such O
as O
insomnia O

lead O

In O
the O

a O
range O

as O
a O
part O
of O
the O
public O

, O
can O
make O

Thus O
, O
mental O

patients B-TERM
, O
suspected O

them O
as O

as O
the O
general O
public O

The O
psychological O

yet O
to O
be O
determined O
before O
a O

. O

This O
is O
probably B-TERM
because O
SARS O
died O
down O
17 O
years O

and O
no O

an O

However O
, O
it O
is O

of O
the O
long O

As O
a O
novel O

, O
COVID O

19 O
has O
just O
started O
to O
manifest O
its O
full O
clinical O

throughout O
thousands O
of O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
patients B-TERM
can O
recover O

However O
, O
similar O
to O
SARS O

MERS O
, O
COVID O

19 O
is O
also B-TERM
associated O
with O
high O
morbidity O
and O
mortality O
in O
patients B-TERM
with O
severe O
cases O
. O

Therefore O
, O
building O
a O
prognosis O

the O

is O
essential O
for O
health O

Cardiac O
events O
were O
also B-TERM
the O
main B-TERM
reason O
for O
death O
in O
SARS O

It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
SARS O

- O
2 O
can O
also B-TERM
bind O
to O
ACE2 O

positive O
cholangiocytes O
, O
which O
might O
lead O
to O
liver O

in O
COVID O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
age O
and O
underlying O
disease B-TERM
are O
strongly O
correlated O
and O
might O
interfere O
with O

The O
C O

reflects O
the O
severity O
of O

a O
potential O

The O
correlation O

has O
also B-TERM

In O

, O
and O
creatine O

may O
also B-TERM

These O

are O
expressed O
extensively O
in O
multiple O

especially B-TERM
in O
the O
heart B-TERM

Major O

Use O
of O
steroids O
: O
As O
described O
above O
, O
steroids O
are O
immunosuppressant O
commonly O
used O
as O
an O
adjunctive O
therapy O
for O
infectious O
diseases O
to O
reduce O
the O
severity O
of O
inflammatory O
damage O
. O

Since O
a O
high O
dosage O
of O
corticosteroids O
was O
widely O
used O
in O
severe O
SARS O
patients B-TERM
, O
many O
survivors O
suffered O
from O
avascular O
osteonecrosis O
with O
life O
- O
long O
disability O
and O
poor O
life O
quality B-TERM
. O

Thus O
, O
if O
needed O
, O
steroids O
should O
be O
used O
at O
low O
dosage O
and O
for O
a O
short O
time O
in O
COVID O
- O
19 O
patients B-TERM
. O

Mental O
stress O
: O
As O
described O
above O
, O
during O
the O
COVID O
- O
19 O
outbreak O
many O
patients B-TERM
have O
suffered O
from O
extraordinary O
stress O
as O
they O
often B-TERM
endured O
long O
periods O
of O
quarantine O
and O
extreme O
uncertainty O
and O
witnessed O
the O
death O
of O
close O
family O
members O
and O
fellow O
patients B-TERM
. O

It O
is O
imperative O
to O
provide O
psychological O
counseling O
and O
long O
- O
term O
support O
to O
help B-TERM
these O
patients B-TERM
recover O
from O
the O
stress O
and O
return O
to O
normal B-TERM
life O
. O

According O
to O
demographic O
studies B-TERM
so O
far O
, O
COVID O
- O
19 O
seems O
to O
have O
different O
epidemiological O
features O
from O
SARS O
. O

In O
addition B-TERM
to O
replicating O
in O
the O
lower O
respiratory O
tract O
, O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
can O
efficiently O
replicate O
in O
the O
upper O
respiratory O
tract O
and O
causes O
mild O
or O
no O
symptoms O
in O
the O
early O
phase O
of O
infection O
, O
similar O
to O
other O
CoVs O
that O
cause B-TERM
common O
colds O
. O

Therefore O
, O
infected O
patients B-TERM
at O
the O
early O
phase O
or O
incubation O
period O
can O
produce O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
virus O
during O
daily O
activities O
, O
causing O
great O
difficulty O
for O
the O
control O
of O
the O
epidemic O
. O

However O
, O
the O
transmission O
of O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
was O
considered O
to O
occur O
when O
the O
patients B-TERM
are O
severely O
ill O
, O
while O
most O
transmission O
did O
not O
happen O
at O
the O
early O
phase O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
current O
outbreak O
of O
COVID O
- O
19 O
is O
much O
more O
severe O
and O
difficult B-TERM
to O
control O
than O
the O
outbreak O
of O
SARS O
. O

Great O
efforts O
are O
currently O
underway O
in O
China O
including O
the O
lockdown O
of O
Wuhan O
and O
surrounding O
cities O
and O
continuous O
quarantine O
of O
almost O
the O
entire B-TERM
population O
in O
hopes O
of O
interrupting O
the O
transmission O
of O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
. O

Although B-TERM
these O
actions O
have O
been O
dramatically O
damaging O
the O
economy O
and O
other O
sectors O
of O
the O
country O
, O
the O
number B-TERM
of O
new O
patients B-TERM
is O
declining O
, O
indicating O
the O
slowdown O
of O
the O
epidemic O
. O

The O
most O
optimistic O
estimate O
is O
that O
the O
outbreak O
will O
end O
by O
March O
and O
the O
downswing O
phase O
will O
last O
for O
3 O
- O
4 O
months O
. O

However O
, O
some O
other O
experts B-TERM
are O
not O
that O
optimistic O
. O

Paul O
Hunter O
, O
et O
al O
. O
, O
estimated O
that O
COVID O
- O
19 O
, O
which O
seems B-TERM
substantially O
more O
infectious O
than O
SARS O
, O
will O
not O
end O
in O
2020 O
. O

Ira O
Longini O
, O
et O
al O
. O
, O
established O
a O
model O
to O
predict O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
epidemic O
and O
suggested O
that O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
could O
infect O
two B-TERM
- O
thirds O
of O
the O
global O
population O
. O

A O
Canadian O
group O
reported O
that O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
was O
detected O
in O
both O
mid O
- O
turbinate O
and O
throat O
swabs O
of O
patients B-TERM
who O
recovered O
and O
left O
the O
hospital O
2 O
weeks O
earlier O
, O
which O
indicates B-TERM
that O
the O
newly O
identified O
virus O
could O
become O
a O
cyclical B-TERM
episode O
similar O
to O
influenza O
. O

However O
, O
promising O
signs O
have O
occurred O
in O
China O
based O
on O
the O
declining B-TERM
number B-TERM
of O
new O
cases O
, O
indicating B-TERM
the O
current O
strategies O
might O
have O
been O
working O
. O

Ebola O
was O
originally O
predicted O
to O
cause O
up O
to O
a O
million O
cases O
with O
half O
a O
million O
deaths O
. O

However O
, O
via O
strict O
quarantine O
and O
isolation O
, O
the O
disease B-TERM
has O
eventually B-TERM
been O
put O
under O
control O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
, O
similar O
to O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
, O
that O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
might O
become O
weaker O
in O
infectivity O
and O
eventually O
die O
down O
or O
become O
a O
less O
pathogenic O
virus O
co O
- O
existent O
with O
humans O
. O

A O
comparison O
of O
the O
epidemic O
of O
COVID O
- O
19 O
with O
that O
of O
SARS O
and O
MERS O
is O
provided O
below O
( O
Fig O
. O
( O
Fig.55 O
) O
. O

SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
is O
highly O
transmittable O
through O
coughing O
or O
sneezing O
, O
and O
possibly B-TERM
also B-TERM
through O
direct O
contact O
with O
materials B-TERM
contaminated O
by O
the O
virus O
. O

The O
virus O
was O
also B-TERM
found O
in O
feces O
, O
which O
raises O
a O
new O
possibility O
of O
feces O
- O
to O
- O
mouth O
transmission O
. O

A O
recent B-TERM
study B-TERM
on O
138 O
cases O
reported O
that O
41 O
% O
of O
the O
cases O
were O
possibly B-TERM
caused O
by O
nosocomial O
infections O
, O
including O
17 O
patients B-TERM
with O
other O
prior O
diseases B-TERM
and O
40 O
health O
- O
care O
providers O
. O

Thus O
, O
great O
precaution O
should O
be O
used O
to O
protect O
humans O
, O
especially B-TERM
health O
- O
care O
providers O
, O
social O
workers O
, O
family O
members O
, O
colleagues O
, O
and O
even O
bystanders O
in O
contact O
with O
patients B-TERM
or O
infected O
people O
. O

The O
first O
line O
of O
defense O
that O
could O
be O
used O
to O
lower O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
is O
through O
wearing O
face O
masks O
; O
both O
the O
use O
of O
surgical O
masks O
and O
N95 O
respirator O
masks O
( O
series O
# O
1860s O
) O
helps O
control O
the O
spread O
of O
viruses O
. O

Surgical O
face O
masks O
prevent O
liquid O
droplets O
from O
a O
potentially O
infected O
individual O
from O
traveling O
through O
the O
air B-TERM
or O
sticking O
onto O
surfaces O
of O
materials O
, O
where O
they O
could O
be O
passed O
on O
to O
others O
. O

However O
, O
only O
N95 O
( O
series O
# O
1860s O
) O
masks O
can O
protect B-TERM
against O
the O
inhalation O
of O
virions O
as O
small O
as O
10 O
to O
80 O
nm O
, O
with O
only O
5 O
% O
of O
the O
virions O
being O
able O
to O
penetrate O
completely O
; O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
is O
similar O
to O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
in O
size B-TERM
and O
both O
are O
approximately B-TERM
85 O
nm O
. O

Since O
particles O
can O
penetrate O
even O
five O
surgical O
masks O
stacked O
together B-TERM
, O
health O
- O
care O
providers O
in O
direct O
contact O
with O
patients B-TERM
must O
wear O
N95 O
( O
series O
# O
1860s O
) O
masks O
but O
not O
surgical O
masks O
. O

In O
addition B-TERM
to O
masks O
, O
health O
- O
care O
providers O
should O
wear O
fitted O
isolation O
gowns O
in O
order O
to O
further O
reduce B-TERM
contact O
with O
viruses O
. O

Viruses O
can O
also B-TERM
infect O
an O
individual O
through O
the O
eyes B-TERM
. O

On O
January O
22 O
, O
2020 O
, O
a O
doctor B-TERM
was O
infected O
with O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
although O
he O
wore O
an O
N95 O
mask O
; O
the O
virus O
might O
have O
entered O
his O
body O
through O
his O
inflammatory O
eyes B-TERM
. O

Thus O
, O
health O
- O
care O
providers O
should O
also B-TERM
wear O
transparent O
face O
shields O
or O
goggles O
while O
working O
with O
patients O
. O

For O
the O
general O
public O
in O
affected O
or O
potentially O
affected O
areas O
, O
it O
is O
highly O
suggested O
that O
everybody O
wash O
their O
hands O
with O
disinfectant O
soaps O
more O
often B-TERM
than O
usual B-TERM
, O
try B-TERM
to O
stay O
indoors O
for O
self O
- O
quarantine O
and O
limit O
contact O
with O
potentially O
infected O
individuals O
. O

Three O
feet O
is O
considered O
an O
appropriate O
distance B-TERM
for O
people O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
a O
patient B-TERM
. O

These O
actions O
are O
effective O
methods O
to O
lower O
the O
risk O
of O
infection O
as O
well O
as O
prevent O
the O
spread O
of O
the O
virus O
. O

Although O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
came O
as O
a O
new O
virus O
to O
the O
human O
world O
, O
its O
high O
homology O
to O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
as O
reported O
on O
7 O
January O
2020 O
should O
have O
caused O
high O
alert O
to O
China O
based O
on O
her O
deep O
memory O
of O
the O
SARS O
outbreak O
in O
2003 O
. O

However O
, O
not O
until O
19 O
January O
2020 O
did O
the O
director O
of O
the O
Center O
of O
Disease B-TERM
Control O
of O
Wuhan O
comfort O
the O
citizens O
by O
saying O
that O
the O
novel O

has O
low O
contagiousness O
and O
limited O
reproductivity O
from O
human O
to O
human O
and O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
to O
prevent O
and O
contain O
the O

This O
message O
remarkably O
relaxed O

( O

more O

The O
outbreak O
of O
COVID O
- O
19 O
caused B-TERM
by O
the O
novel O
virus O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
started O
in O
the O
end B-TERM
of O
December O
2019 O
. O

In O
less O
than O
two B-TERM
months O
, O
it O
has O
spread O
all O
over O
China O
and O
near O
50 O
other O
countries O
globally O
at O
the O
time O
of O
this O
writing O
. O

Since O
the O
virus O
is O
very O
similar B-TERM
to O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
and O
the O
symptoms O
are O
also O
similar O
between O
COVID O
- O
19 O
and O
SARS O
, O
the O
outbreak O
of O
COVID O
- O
19 O
has O
created O
a O
sense B-TERM
of O
SARS O
recurring O
. O

However O
, O
there O
are O
some O
remarkable O
differences B-TERM
between O
COVID O
- O
19 O
and O
SARS O
, O
which O
are O
essential O
for O
containing O
the O
epidemic O
and O
treating O
the O
patients B-TERM
. O

COVID O
- O
19 O
affects O
more O
elderly O
individuals O
than O
youth O
and O
more O
men O
than O
women O
, O
and O
the O
severity O
and O
death O
rate O
are O
also B-TERM
higher O
in O
elderly O
individual O
than O
in O
youth O
. O

SARS O
has O
higher O
mortality O
than O
COVID O
- O
19 O
( O
10.91 O
% O
versus O
1.44 O
% O
) O
. O

COVID O
- O
19 O
patients O
transmit O
the O
virus O
even O
when O
they O
are O
symptomless O
whereas O
SARS O
patients B-TERM
do O
so O
usually O
when O
they O
are O
severely O
ill O
, O
which O
causes O
much O
greater O
difficulty O
to O
contain O
the O
spread O
of O
COVID O
- O
19 O
than O
SARS O
. O

This O
partially O
explains O
why O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
spread O
much O
faster O
and O
broader O
than O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
. O

The O
regular O
RNA O
assay O
for O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
can O
be O
negative O
in O
some O
COVID O
- O
19 O
patients B-TERM
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
cured O
patients B-TERM
can O
be O
positive O
for O
the O
virus O
again O
. O

These O
findings O
dramatically O
increase O
the O
risk O
of O
virus O
spreading O
. O

Given O
such O
rapid B-TERM
progress O
in O
research O
on O
COVID O
- O
19 O
, O
several O
critical O
issues O
remain O
to O
be O
solved O
, O
as O
follows O
: O

Where O
did O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
come O
from O
? O

Although O
96 O
% O
genetic O
homolog O
was O
found O
between O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
and O
two B-TERM
bat O
SARS O
- O
like O
CoVs O
, O
we O
still O
cannot O
conclude O
that O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
is O
from O
bats O
. O

What O
animal B-TERM
was O
the O
intermediate O
species O
to O
transmit O
the O
virus O
from O
the O
original O
host O
, O
say O
bats O
, O
to O
humans O
? O

Without O
knowing O
answers B-TERM
to O
# O
1 O
and O
2 O
, O
we O
cannot O
efficiently O
cut O
the O
transmission O
, O
and O
the O
outbreak O
can O
relapse O
at O
any O
time O
. O

Although O
molecular O
modeling O
and O
biochemical O
assays O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
binds O
to O
ACE2 O
, O
how O
exactly B-TERM
does O
the O
virus O
enter O
the O
airway O
cells O
and O
cause O
subsequent O
pathological O
changes B-TERM
? O

Does O
the O
virus O
also B-TERM
bind O
ACE2 O
- O
expressing O
cells O
in O
other O
organs O
? O

Without O
clear O
answers B-TERM
to O
these O
questions O
, O
we O
cannot O
achieve O
fast O
and O
accurate O
diagnosis O
and O
effective B-TERM
treatment O
. O

How O
long O
will O
the O
epidemic O
last O
? O

How O
is O
the O
virus O
genetically O
evolving B-TERM
during O
transmission O
among O
humans O
? O

Will O
it O
become O
a O
pandemic O
worldwide O
, O
die O
down O
like B-TERM
SARS O
or O
relapse O
periodically O
like B-TERM
the O
flu O
? O

It O
is O
essential O
but O
may O
take O
some O
time O
to O
search O
for O
answers B-TERM
to O
the O
above O
and O
many O
other O
questions O
. O

However O
, O
with O
whatever O
expense O
it O
may O
demand O
, O
we O
have O
no O
other O
choice B-TERM
but O
to O
stop O
the O

" O

Earlier O

the O

In O
his O

for O
this O
Ukraine O
must O
fulfill B-TERM
certain O
conditions B-TERM
. O

On O
5 O
June O
Rada O
deputy O
Yevgeny O

said O
that O
the O
possible B-TERM
accession O
of O
Ukraine O
to O
the O
alliance B-TERM
does O
not O
guarantee O
improved O
life O
in O
the O
country O
. O

Money O
is O
more O
important B-TERM
than O
football O
. O

Barcelona O
is O
coercing O
Neymar O

Spanish O
club O
Barcelona O
and O
its O
former B-TERM
Brazilian O
football O
player O
Neymar O
are O
attempting B-TERM
to O
resolve O
a O
financial O
dispute B-TERM
, O
which O
arose O
after O
the O
striker O
's O
move O
to O
French O
club O
Paris O
Saint O
- O
Germain O
. O

The O
matter O
almost O
reached O
the O
courts O
, O
but O
the O
Catalonians O
offered O
the O
player O
a O
resolution O
without O
the O
need O
for O
the O
courts O
' O
involvement O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
they O
refused O
to O
allow O
his O
return O
. O

Neymar O
and O
his O
astute O
father B-TERM
, O
who O
is O
also B-TERM
the O
Brazilian O
's O
agent O
, O
contrived O
an O
interesting O
maneuverer O
: O
according O
to O
the O
agreement B-TERM
with O
Barcelona O
, O
which O
the O
player O
signed O
in O
2016 O
, O
he O
was O
due O
to O
receive B-TERM
40 O
million O
euros O
. O

However O
, O
after O
literally O
one O
year O
, O
the O
forward O
moved O
to O
Paris O
Saint O
- O
Germain O
for O
a O
record O
222 O
million O
euros O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
he O
received B-TERM
22 O
million O
from O
the O
Catalonians O
and O
now O
wants B-TERM
to O
claim O
the O
remaining O
18 O
million O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
Brazilian O
's O
lawyers O
insist O
that O
the O
club O
owes O
him O
interest O
for O
late O
payments O
. O

When O
Neymar O
's O
demands O
became O
known O
in O
the O
capital O
of O
Catalonia O
, O
Barcelona O
filed O
a O
counterclaim O
. O

The O
club O
insists O
that O
the O
bonus B-TERM
is O
dependent O
on O
the O
entire B-TERM
contract B-TERM
being O
fulfilled O
- O
from O
2016 O
to O
2022 O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
club O
considers B-TERM
that O
the O
player O
is O
entitled O
to O
only O
one O
- O
quarter O
of O
the O
40 O
million O
euros O
and O
demands O
the O
return O
of O
a O
portion B-TERM
of O
the O
first O
payment O
. O

But O
most O
interestingly O
, O
Neymar O
and O
Barcelona O
almost O
agreed O
that O
the O
" O
prodigal O
" O
player O
would O
return O
to O
Catalonia O
's O
fold O
in O
summer O
. O

But O
the O
agreement O
collapsed O
, O
however O
, O
hope O
remains O
that O
the O
forward O
will O
return O
. O

Citing O
insiders O
, O
Sports.ru O
reports O
that O
the O
club O
's O
lawyers O
informed B-TERM
the O
player O
's O
representatives O
that O
if O
the O
financial O
demands O
are O
not O
settled O
out O
of O
court O
, O
then O
the O
Brazilian O
's O
return O
can O
be O
ruled O
out O
. O

Neymar O
himself O
wants B-TERM
so O
strongly O
to O
return O
that O
he O
has O
asked O
for O
guarantees O
that O
the O
Catalonians O
will O
buy O
him O
back O
. O

Conclusions B-TERM

William O

" O
I O

" O

The O

The O

Studies B-TERM

to O
8.2 O

Some O
have O
proposed O
that O

transmitted O
by O
small O

that O
stay O

including O
when O

though O
the O

is O
not O
generally O
airborne O

The O
droplets O
can O
land O
in O
the O

or O
noses O
of O
people O
who O
are O
nearby O
or O
possibly O
be O
inhaled O
into O
the O
lungs O
. O

Some O
medical O
procedures O
such O
as O
intubation O
and O
cardiopulmonary O
resuscitation O
( O
CPR O
) O
may O
cause O
respiratory O
secretions O
to O
be O
aerosolized O
and O
thus O
result O
in O
airborne O
spread O
. O

It O
may O
also B-TERM
spread O
when O
one O
touches O
a O
contaminated O
surface O
, O
including O
skin O
, O
and O
then O
touches O
their O
eyes B-TERM
, O

, O
or O

. O

While O
there O
are O
concerns O
it O
may O
spread O
by O
faeces O
, O
this O
risk O
is O
believed O
to O
be O
low O

The O
Government O

virus O
is O
most O

Strategies O
in O
the O
control O
of O
an O
outbreak O
are O
containment O
or O
suppression O
, O
and O
mitigation O
. O

Containment O
is O
undertaken O
in O
the O
early O
stages B-TERM
of O
the O
outbreak O
and O
aims B-TERM
to O
trace O
and O
isolate O
those O
infected O
as O
well O
as O
introduce O
other O
measures B-TERM
of O
infection O
control O
and O
vaccinations B-TERM
to O
stop O
the O
disease B-TERM
from O
spreading O
to O
the O
rest B-TERM
of O
the O
population O
. O

When O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
possible O
to O
contain O
the O
spread O
of O
the O
disease B-TERM
, O
efforts O
then O
move O
to O
the O
mitigation O
stage B-TERM
: O
measures B-TERM
are O
taken O
to O
slow O
the O
spread O
and O
mitigate O
its O
effects O
on O
the O
healthcare O
system O
and O
society O
. O

A O
combination O
of O
both O
containment O
and O
mitigation O
measures B-TERM
may O
be O
undertaken O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Suppression O
requires O
more O
extreme O
measures B-TERM
so O
as O
to O
reverse O
the O
pandemic O
by O
reducing B-TERM
the O
basic B-TERM
reproduction O
number B-TERM
to O
less O
than O
1.Part O
of O
managing O
an O
infectious O
disease B-TERM
outbreak O
is O
trying O
to O
decrease B-TERM
the O
epidemic O
peak O
, O
known O
as O
flattening O
the O
epidemic O
curve O
. O

This O
decreases O
the O
risk O
of O
health O
services O
being O
overwhelmed O
and O
provides O
more O
time O
for O
vaccines B-TERM
and O
treatments O
to O
be O
developed O
. O

Non O
- O
pharmaceutical O
interventions O
that O
may O
manage O
the O
outbreak O
include O
personal O
preventive O
measures B-TERM
, O
such O
as O
hand O
hygiene O
, O
wearing O
face O
- O
masks O
, O
and O

quarantine O
; O
community O
measures B-TERM

drastic O
actions O
aimed O

were O
taken O
in O
China O
once O
the O

such O
as O
quarantining O

a O
variety O
of O
measures B-TERM
aimed O
at O
limiting O
the O

of O
the O

Though O

Some O
medical O

this O

Some O
doctors O
prefer O
staying O

Many O

three O
vaccination B-TERM
strategies O

First O
, O
researchers O
aim O
to O

vaccine B-TERM

The O
use O
of O
such O
a O
virus O

of O
the O
human O
body O
to O
a O
new O
infection O
with O
COVID O
- O
19 O
. O

A O
second O
strategy O
, O
subunit O
vaccines B-TERM
, O
aims O
to O
create O
a O
vaccine B-TERM
that O
sensitises O
the O
immune O
system O
to O
certain O
subunits O
of O
the O
virus O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
, O
such O
research O
focuses O
on O
the O
S O
- O
spike O
protein B-TERM
that O
helps B-TERM
the O

intrude O
the O

. O

Experimental O
vaccines B-TERM

strategies O
would O
have O
to O
be O
tested O

efficacy.On O
16 O
March O

, O
the O
first O
clinical O
trial O
of O
a O
vaccine B-TERM
started O
with O
four O

The O
vaccine B-TERM

a O
harmless O
genetic O
code O
copied O
from O
the O

The O
most O
well O

But O

studied O
quite O
thoroughly O

demonstrate O
positive O
effects O

For O

, O
taking O
them O

We O
find O
ourselves O
in O
remarkable O
circumstances O
this O
month O
. O

The O
COVID O
- O
19 O
epidemic O
is O
something O
that O
makes O
clear O
our O
global O
human O
interconnectedness O
and O
the O
responsibilities O
we O
have O
to O
one O
another O
. O

We O
don O
't O
have O
precedent O
for O
its O
challenges B-TERM
, O
but O
we O
do O
know O
that O
our O
best O
response O
relies O
on O
the O
sort O
of O
global O
empathy O
, O
cooperation B-TERM
, O
and O
community O
building O
that O
sits O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
this O
organization B-TERM
. O

The O
camaraderie O
and O
care O
we O
have O
seen O
among B-TERM
all O
of O
our O
colleagues O
over O
email O
, O
calls O
, O
and O
chats O
is O
a O
remarkable B-TERM
validation O
of O
the O
incredible O
humans O
we O
are O
fortunate O
enough O
to O
work O
with O
. O

I O
couldn O
't O
be O
more O
grateful O
and O
proud O
to O
count O
you O
all O
as O
colleagues O
. O

Last O
week O
, O
someone O
shared O
with O
me O
their O
appreciation O
for O
our O
work O
. O

They O
reminded O
me O
how O
meaningful O
it O
is O
for O
the O
world O
to O
be O
able O
to O
turn O
to O
Wikipedia O
right O
now O
, O
and O
what O
a O
powerful O
symbol O
it O
is O
for O
this O
critical O
resource O
to O
remain O
online O
and O
available O
to O
all O
. O

Your O
work O
makes O
this O
possible B-TERM
, O
whether O
you O
keep O
the O
sites O
stay O
up O
or O
our O
colleagues O
paid O
or O
our O
communities O
safe O
. O

The O
world O
needs B-TERM
the O
information B-TERM
that O
Wikipedia O
provides O
, O
now O
more O
than O
ever O
. O

This O
is O
a O
moment O
in O
which O
not O
only O
what O
we O
do O
, O
but O
how O
we O
do O
it O
, O
will O
make O
a O
meaningful B-TERM
impact O
on O
the O
world O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
importance B-TERM
of O
this O
mission O
and O
your O
role B-TERM
in O
it O
, O
we O
will O
be O
making O
some O
significant B-TERM
adjustments O
to O
how O
we O
work O
together O
, O
starting O
this O
coming O
week O
. O

Adjustments O
to O
our O
work O
and O
schedules O

As O
Robyn O
mentioned O
previously O
, O
the O
c O
- O
team O
met O
last O
night O
to O
discuss O
our O
approach O
and O
schedule O
for O
the O
coming O
days O
and O
months O
. O

In O
that O
conversation O
, O
we O
considered B-TERM
what O
we O
thought B-TERM
would O
be O
an O
appropriate O
response O
to O
what O
we O
're O
facing O
and O
the O
best O
way B-TERM
to O
keep O
the O
organization B-TERM
sustainable O
during O
this O
time O
. O

Overwhelmingly O
we O
wanted B-TERM
to O
remove O
stress O
and O
support O
our O
mission O
for O
the O
long O
term O
. O

If O
you O
need O
to O
dial O
back O
, O
that O
's O
okay O
. O

For O
all O
staff B-TERM
, O
contractors O
, O
and O
contract O
workers O
: O

our O
daily O
working O
expectations B-TERM
will O
be O
about O
4 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
or O
20 O
hours O
a O
week O
until O
further O
notice O
. O

We O
're O
not O
declaring B-TERM
a O
holiday O
- O
if O
you O
are O
able O
to O
work O
more O
normal O
hours O
, O
the O
mission O
can O
use O
you O
. O

However O
, O
the O
world O
is O
unpredictable O
right O
now O
, O
and O
whether O
you O
need O
to O
care O
for O
loved O
ones O
, O
get O
groceries O
, O
or O
go O
to O
the O
doctor B-TERM
, O
your O
well O
- O
being O
is O
our O
priority O
. O

We O
are O
not O
tracking O
your O
time O
. O

If O
you O
are O
sick O
, O
do O
not O
work O
. O

This O
should O
go O
without O
saying O
, O
but O
we O
're O
saying O
it O
. O

No O
sick O
days O
or O
PTO O
required O
- O
just O
tell O
your O
manager O
and O
help B-TERM
your O
team O
revise O
calendars O
and O
schedules O
to O
make O
sure O
key O
areas B-TERM
of O
work O
are O
covered O
. O

( O
If O
you O

for O

, O
please O
let O
Bryan O

sure O
your O
situation B-TERM
gets O
appropriate O
attention O
from O
management B-TERM
) O
. O

Hourly O
folks O
will O
be O
fully O
paid O
. O

We O
have O
already O
said O
, O
and O
are O
recommitting O
to O
honor O
our O
commitments O
to O
our O
contractors O
and O
hourly O
staff B-TERM
colleagues O
. O

Everyone O
will O
be O
paid O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
their O
usual B-TERM
hours O
worked O
during O
normal B-TERM
circumstances O
. O

This O
includes O
if O
you O
are O
sick O
and O
unable O
to O
work O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
work O
, O
we O
support O
you O
. O

Many O
people O
use B-TERM
work O
as O
a O
way B-TERM
of O
channeling O
their O
stress O
with O
the O
world O
around O
us O
. O

What O
we O
do O
can O
be O
incredibly O
rewarding O
, O
especially B-TERM
during O
times O
like O
this O
. O

Again O
, O
this O
is O
about O
your O
self O
- O
care O
. O

Our O
ask O
is O
that O
you O
communicate O
with O
your O
manager O
, O
so O
we O
know O
what O
to O
expect B-TERM
and O
can O
adjust O
accordingly O
. O

Some O
work O
is O
considered O
essential O
. O

There O
are O
some O
things O
that O
we O
must O
keep O
doing O
. O

The O
SRE O
, O
HR O
Ops O
, O
Trust O
& O
Safety O
, O
and O
Fundraising O
teams O
( O
among O
others O
) O
do O
critical O
work O
that O
may O
need O
additional O
support O
. O

We O
'll O
begin O
a O
process O
with O
all O
departments O
to O
assess O
current B-TERM
objectives B-TERM
and O
shift O
our O
focus O
to O
supporting O
what O
's O
essential O
for O
our O
mission O
. O

There O
's O
plenty B-TERM
to O
do O
for O
all O
of O
us O
, O
we O
just O
will O
all O
focus O
on O
the O
most O
essential O
projects B-TERM
. O

Slowing O
now O
won O
't O
hurt O
later O
. O

We O
do O
not O
plan O
to O
go O
" O
double O
- O
time O
to O
catch O
up O
" O
once O
the O
pandemic O
has O
passed O
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
expected O
to O
work O
extra O
hours O
to O
meet O
deadlines O
which O
are O
now O
unrealistic O
. O

We O
accept O
that O
circumstances O
have O
changed O
, O
and O
will O
work O
to O
set O
new O
targets B-TERM
and O
timelines O
where O
appropriate O
. O

What O
happens O
with O
the O
APP O
( O

) O
? O

To O
adjust O
to O
our O
new O
reality B-TERM
and O
daily B-TERM
working O

expectations B-TERM
, O
we O
intend B-TERM
to O
adjust O
the O
timeline O
for O
the O
delivery O
of O
our O
2020 O
- O
2021 O
Annual O

. O

Our O
intention O
is O
to O
propose O
an O
extension O
of O
our O
2019 O
- O
2020 O
plan O
that O
allows O
more O
time O
for O

to O
allow B-TERM

to O
prioritize O
critical O
work O
, O
self O

, O
and O
care O
for O

accommodating O
those O
who O
need O
or O
wish O
to O
work O
a O
reduced B-TERM
schedule O
over O
the O
next O
few O
weeks O
. O

This O
timeline O
extension O
greatly B-TERM
reduces B-TERM
current B-TERM
planning O
workloads O
and O
pressure O
across O
the O
whole B-TERM
organization B-TERM
. O

We O
will O
introduce O
our O

to O

next O

will O
update O

on O
the O
next B-TERM

we O
have O

However O
, O
out O
of O
an O

we O
employed O
an O
antiviral O
cleaning O
crew B-TERM
to O
disinfect O
all O

in O
the O
San O

They O
utilized O

that O

be O

Coronaviruses O
( O
CoVs O

belong O
to O
the O
family B-TERM
Coronaviridae O
, O
which O
comprises O
a O
group O
of O
enveloped O

These O
viruses O
harbouring O
the O

were O
termed O
" O
CoVs O
" O
because O
of O
their O
crown O

. O

Structurally O
, O
CoVs O
have O
non O

segmented O
genomes O
that O
share O
a O

Approximately O
two O

of O
the O
genome O
contain O
two B-TERM
large O

, O
which O
are O
translated O
into O
the O

The O
polyproteins O
are O
further O
processed O
to O
generate O
16 O

The O
remaining O
portion B-TERM
of O
the O

Based O
on O
the O
difference B-TERM
in O
protein O
sequences B-TERM
, O
CoVs O
are O
classified O
into O
four O
genera O
( O

Particularly O
, O
we O
highlight O

HCoVs O
are O
typically O
non O

We O
also B-TERM
review O
the O
trend B-TERM
of O

in O
which O
the O
increase O

. O

The O
first O
HCoV O

229E O
strain O
was O
isolated O
from O
the O
respiratory O

The O
clinical O

appear B-TERM
to O
be O
similar B-TERM
to O
those O
caused O
by O

which O
are O
symptomatically O
indistinguishable O
from O
infection O
with O
other O

On O
the O
other O

, O
a O
small B-TERM
subset O
of O
severe O
cases O
of O
COVID O
- O

can O
also O
be O
seen O
as O
in O
the O

, O
although B-TERM
the O
ratio O
is O
a O

Third O
, O
the O
transmission O
of O
SARS O

2 O
also B-TERM
shows O
interesting O
patterns O
characteristic O
of O
both O
community O

acquired O
HCoVs O
and O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
. O

On O
one O
hand O
, O
the O
transmissibility O
of O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
is O
at O
least O
as O
high O
as O
that O
of O
community O
- O
acquired O
HCoVs O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
verified O
whether O
the O
transmissibility O
of O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
decreases O
after O
passages O
in O
humans O
as O
in O
the O
cases O
of O
SARS O

. O

Finally O
, O
same O
as O
the O
other O
HCoVs O
, O
SARS O

CoV O
- O
2 O
can O
be O
detected O
in O
fecal O

Whether O
fecal O

oral O
transmission O

2 O
plays O
an O
important B-TERM
role O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
at O
least O
under O
some O
circumstance O
remains O
to O
be O
clarified O
by O
future O
studies O
. O

It O
is O
also O
of O
particularly O
great O
interest O
to O
see O
whether O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
might O
exhibit O
seasonality O
as O
in O
the O
cases O
of O
community O
- O
acquired O
HCoVs O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
features B-TERM
of O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
including O
its O
transmissibility O
, O
pathogenicity O
and O
sustainable B-TERM
spreading O
after O
passages O
in O
humans O
will O
be O
influential O
on O
the O
ultimate O
fate O
of O
the O
ongoing O
outbreak O
of O
COVID O
- O
19 O
. O

All O
four O
community O
- O
acquired O
HCoVs O
causing B-TERM
mild O
symptoms O
have O
been O
well O
adapted B-TERM
to O
humans O
. O

From O
another B-TERM
perspective O
, O
it O
might O
also O
be O
true O
that O
humans O
have O
been O
well O
adapted B-TERM
to O
these O
four O
HCoVs O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
both O
could O
be O
the O
survivors O
of O
ancient O
HCoV O
pandemics O
. O

HCoVs O
that O
cause O
severe O
diseases B-TERM
in O
humans O
and O
humans O
who O
developed O
severe O
HCoV O
diseases B-TERM
have O
been O
eliminated O
. O

For O
this O
to O
happen O
, O
HCoVs O
have O
to O
replicate O
in O
humans O
to O
sufficient O
extent O
to O
allow O
the O
accumulation B-TERM
of O
adaptive O
mutations O
that O
counteract O
host O
restriction O
factors O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
the O
longer O
the O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
outbreak O
persists O
and O
the O
more O
people O
that O
it O
infects O
, O
the O
greater O
chance O
that O
it O
will O
fully O
adapt B-TERM
to O
humans O
. O

If O
it O
adapts B-TERM
well O
, O
its O
transmission O
in O
humans O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
stop O
by O
quarantine O
or O
other O
infection O
control O
measures B-TERM
. O

For O
many O
years O
, O
the O
four O
community O
- O
acquired O
CoVs O
circulate O
in O
human O
populations O
, O
triggering O
common O
cold O
in O
immunocompetent O
subjects O
. O

These O
viruses O
do O
not O
need O
an O
animal B-TERM
reservoir O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
highly O
pathogenic O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
and O
MERS O
- O
CoV O
have O
not O
adapted B-TERM
to O
humans O
well O
and O
their O
transmission O
within O
humans O
cannot O
be O
sustained O
. O

They O
need O
to O
maintain O
and O
propagate O
in O
their O
zoonotic O
reservoirs O
and O
seek O
the O
chance O
to O
spillover O
to O

human O
targets O
, O
possibly B-TERM
via B-TERM
one O
or O
more O
intermediate O

. O

SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
has O
features B-TERM
that O
are O
similar B-TERM
to O
both O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
/ O
MERS O
- O
CoV O
and O
the O
four O
community O

It O
is O
highly B-TERM
transmissible O
like B-TERM
community O
- O
acquired O
HCoVs O
, O
at O
least O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
more O
pathogenic O
than O
community O

acquired O
HCoVs O
and O
less O
pathogenic O
than O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
or O
MERS O
- O
CoV O
. O

It O
remains O
to O
be O
seen O
whether O
it O
will O
adapt B-TERM
fully O
to O
humans O
and O
circulate O
within O
humans O
without O
a O
reservoir O
or O
intermediate O
animal B-TERM
host O
. O

Before O
discussing O
the O
animal B-TERM
origins O
of O
HCoVs O
, O
it O
will O
serve O
us O
well O
to O
discuss O
the O
definitions O
and O
characteristics O
of O
evolutionary O
, O
natural B-TERM
, O
reservoir O
, O
intermediate O
and O
amplifying O
hosts O
of O
HCoVs O
. O

An O
animal B-TERM
serves O
as O
the O
evolutionary O
host O
of O
an O
HCoV O
if O
it O
harbours O
a O
closely O
related O
ancestor O
sharing O
high O
homology O
at O
the O
level O
of O
nucleotide O
sequence B-TERM
. O

The O
ancestral O
virus O
is O
usually O
well O
adapted O
and O
non O
- O
pathogenic O
in O
this O
host O
. O

Likewise O
, O
a O
reservoir O
host O
harbours O
HCoV O
continuously B-TERM
and O
for O
long O
term O
. O

In O
both O
cases O
, O
the O
hosts O
are O
naturally O
infected O
and O
are O
the O
natural B-TERM
hosts O
of O
HCoV O
or O
its O
parental O
virus O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
if O
the O
HCoV O
is O
newly O
introduced O
to O
an O
intermediate O
host O
right O
before O
or O
around B-TERM
its O
introduction O
to O
humans O
, O
it O
is O
not O
well O
adapted O
to O
the O
new O
host O
and O
is O
often B-TERM
pathogenic O
. O

This O
intermediate O
host O
can O
serve O
as O
the O
zoonotic O
source O
of O
human O
infection O
and O
play O
the O
role B-TERM
of O
an O
amplifying O
host O
by O
allowing B-TERM
the O
virus O
to O
replicate O
transiently O
and O
then O
transmitting O
it O
to O
humans O
to O
amplify O
the O
scale O
of O
human O
infection O
. O

An O
HCoV O
can O
undergo O
a O
dead O
- O
end O
infection O
if O
it O
cannot O
sustain O
its O
transmission O
within O
the O
intermediate O
host O
. O

On O
the O
contrary B-TERM
, O
HCoVs O
can O
also B-TERM
adapt B-TERM
to O
the O
intermediate O
host O
and O
even O
establish O
long O
- O
term O
endemicity O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
intermediate O
host O
becomes O
a O
natural B-TERM
reservoir O
host O
. O

Epidemiological O
data B-TERM
revealed B-TERM
retrospectively O
that O
the O
index O
case O
of O
SARS O
had O
a O
contact O
history O
with O
game O
animals B-TERM
. O

Subsequent O
seroprevalence O
investigations O
indicated B-TERM
that O
animal B-TERM
traders B-TERM
had O
a O
higher O
prevalence O
of O
anti O

CoV O
IgG O
compared O
with O
that O
of O
the O
general O

Masked O
palm O

SARS O

like O
viruses O
that O
are O
almost O
identical B-TERM

This O
was O

the O
fact O
that O
no O
further O

reported O
after O

all O

However O
, O
it O

were O
largely O
negative O
for O

suggesting O
that O
masked O

only O
serve O

not O
the O

All O

Subsequent O
search O
for O
the O

a O

These O

This O

share O
88 O

92 O
% O

with O
SARS O

. O

These O
studies B-TERM
have O
laid O
the O
foundation B-TERM
for O
the O
new O
concept B-TERM
that O

. O

Several O

like B-TERM

have O
also B-TERM

but O
none O
except O

Human O

is O
known O
to O

WIV1 O
derived O

Intriguingly O
, O
sera O

Thus O

Albeit O
the O

that O

Several O
lines O

support O
the O
transmission O

from O

directly O

First O
, O
humans O
but O
not O
alpacas O
might O
have O

bats O
in O
a O
shared O
ecological O
niche O

Instead O
, O
humans O
have O
close O

Second O
, O
HCoV O

- O
related O
bat O
alpha O
- O
CoVs O
are O
diverse O
and O
non O

pathogenic O
in O

, O
whereas O
alpaca O
alpha O
- O
CoV O
caused B-TERM
an O

. O

Finally O
, O
alpaca O
alpha O
- O
CoV O
has O
not O
been O
found O
in O

Thus O
, O
the O
possibility B-TERM
cannot B-TERM
be O
excluded O
that O
alpacas O
obtain O
the O
HCoV O

229E O

alpha O

from O
humans O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
bats O
are O
the O

It O
is O
therefore B-TERM
not O
too O
surprising O
that O

might O
transmit O

to O
humans O
directly B-TERM

Alternatively O
, O
whereas O

serve O
as O
the O
gene O

of O
HCoV O

229E O
, O
alpacas O

might O
serve O
as O

exactly B-TERM
as O
in O

It O
is O

that O

Asymptomatic O

the O

It O
appeared O
that O

For O

, O
defects B-TERM

Besides O
, O
the O
natural O

thus O

the O

Thus O

it O

Herein O
lie O
the O

what O
causes B-TERM
the O

The O
severe O

are O
mainly O
due O

the O

the O

the O

the O

In O
contrast B-TERM
, O
in O
asymptomatic O

, O
the O

been O

The O

strategy O

have O
beneficial O
effects O
in O
anti O

The O
interferon O

Thus O

the O
early O

be O
beneficial O
. O

In O

By O
this O

same O
reasoning O
, O
pangolins O
should O
be O
removed B-TERM
from O
wet O
markets O
to O
prevent O
zoonotic O
transmission O
, O
in O
view O
of O
the O
discovery O
of O
multiple O
lineages O
of O
pangolin O
beta O
- O
CoVs O
closely O
related O
to O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
. O

However O
, O
whether O
and O
how O
SARS O

CoV O
- O
2 O
is O
transmitted O
to O
humans O
through O
pangolins O
and O
other O

remain O
to O
be O
clarified O
in O
future O
investigations O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
MERS O
- O
CoV O
has O
existed O
in O
dromedary O
camels O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

These O
camels O
serve O
as O
an O
important B-TERM
tool O
for O
transportation O
as O
well O
as O
a O
main B-TERM
source O
of O
meat O
, O
milk O
, O
leather O
and O
wool O
products B-TERM
for O
the O
local B-TERM
people O
. O

They O
are O
widely O
distributed O
across O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
Africa O
. O

It O
is O
therefore B-TERM
impossible B-TERM
to O
sacrifice O
all O
camels O
for O
the O
control O
of O
MERS O
, O
as O
what O
was O
done O
in O
wild O
animal B-TERM
markets O
in O
China O
to O
prevent O
the O
spreading O
of O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
and O
SARS O

CoV O
- O
2 O
. O

To O
stop O
the O
recurrent O
outbreaks O
of O
MERS O
, O
a O
comprehensive O
approach O
should O
be O
taken O
to O
develop O
effective B-TERM
vaccines B-TERM
against O
MERS O

CoV O
for O
camels O
, O
in O
combination B-TERM
with O
other O

. O

As O
we O
are O
not O
able O
to O
eliminate B-TERM
these O
viruses O
, O
new O
genotypes O
might O
emerge O
to O
cause O
outbreaks O
. O

A O
variety O
of O
zoonotic O
CoVs O
are O
circulating O
in O
the O
wild O
. O

Particularly O
, O
bat O
CoVs O
with O
zoonotic O
potential O
are O
so O
diverse O
. O

There O
are O
plenty O
of O
opportunities O
that O
these O
zoonotic O
CoVs O
evolve O
and O
recombine O
, O
resulting O
in O
the O
emergence B-TERM
of O
new O
CoVs O
that O
are O
more O
transmissible O
and O
/ O
or O
deadly O
in O
humans O
in O
future O
. O

The O
culture O
of O
eating O
wild O
animals B-TERM
in O
some O
places O
of O
China O
should O
be O
abandoned O
to O
reduce B-TERM
unnecessary O

. O

With O
the O
ordeals O
of O
SARS O

MERS O
and O
COVID O

, O
a O
better O

should O
be O
in O
place O

In O
fact O
, O
many O
viruses O
have O
existed O
in O
the O
planet O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

They O
stay O
in O
their O
own O
natural B-TERM
reservoirs O
until O
there O
is O
a O
chance O
for O

. O

Although B-TERM
bats O
have O
many O
features B-TERM
that O
favours O
the O
spreading O
of O
viruses O
, O
the O
chance O
for O
humans O
to O
be O
in O
contact O
with O
bats O
and O
other O
wildlife O
species O
can O
be O
minimized O
if O
people O
are O

Continuous O
surveillance B-TERM
in O

is O
necessary B-TERM
for O
better O
understanding O
of O
the O
ecology O
of O
CoVs O
and O
their O
natural B-TERM

, O
which O
will O
prove O
useful O
in O
preventing O
animal B-TERM

to O

human O

future O

To O
conclude B-TERM
, O
the O
most O
effective B-TERM
way B-TERM
to O
prevent O
viral O
zoonosis O
is O
for O
humans O
to O
stay O

the O
ecological O

of O

Several O
pieces O
in O
the O
puzzle O
of O
the O
zoonotic O
origin O
of O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
are O
still O
missing O
. O

First O
, O
if O
bats O
transmit O
an O
ancestral O
virus O
of O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
to O
pangolins O
, O
it O
will O
be O
of O
interest O
to O
see O
under O
what O
circumstances O
bats O
and O
pangolins O
could O
share O
the O
same O
ecological O
niche O
. O

Second O
, O
if O
bats O
play O
a O
more O
direct O
role B-TERM
in O
human O
transmission O
, O
how O
humans O
get O
into O
contact O
with O
bats O
should O
be O
determined O
. O

Third O
, O
if O
a O
third O
mammal O
acts O
as O
the O
true B-TERM
intermediate O
host O
, O
how O
it O
interacts O
with O
the O
different O
species O
including O
humans O
, O
bats O
and O
pangolins O
has O
to O
be O
clarified O
. O

Finally O
, O
since O
many O
mammals O
including O
domestic O
animals B-TERM
might O
be O
susceptible O
to O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
, O
both O
surveillance B-TERM
and O
experimental O
infection O
should O
be O
conducted O
. O

Should O
it O
be O
a O
bat O
, O
a O
pangolin O
or O
another B-TERM
mammal O
, O
it O
is O
expected O
that O
SARS O
- O
CoV O
- O
2 O
or O
its O
parental O
viruses O
that O
are O
almost O
identical O
will O
be O
identified O
in O
its O
natural B-TERM
hosts O
in O
future O
. O

Continued O
investigations O
in O
this O
area B-TERM
will O
elucidate O
the O
evolutionary O
pathway O
of O
SARS O

2 O
in O
animals B-TERM
, O
with O
important B-TERM
implications B-TERM
in O
the O
prevention O
and O

of O
