YORK O
- O
A O
famous B-TERM
claim O
in O
economics O
is O
that O
the O
cost O
of O
services O
( O
such O
as O
health O
care O
and O
education O
) O
tends O
to O
increase O
relative O
to O
the O
cost O
of O
goods O
( O
such O
as O
food O
, O
oil O
, O
and O
machinery O
) O
. O
this O
seems O
right O
: O
people O
around O
the O
world O
can O
barely O
afford O
the O
rising O
health O
- O
care O
and O
school O
- O
tuition O
costs O
they O
currently O
face O
- O
costs O
that O
seem O
to O
increase O
each O
year O
faster O
than O
overall O
inflation O
. O

a O
second O
problem B-TERM
is O
that O
there O
are O
no O
moral B-TERM
principles O
that O
are O
shared O
by O
all O
religious O
people O
, O
regardless O
of O
their O
specific O
beliefs O
, O
but O
by O
no O
agnostics O
and O
atheists O
. O

But O
for O
this O
, O
we O
need B-TERM
to O
identify O
both O
the O
user O
and O
the O
space O
around O
him O
. O

the O
goal B-TERM
is O
breathtaking O
: O
more O
than O
80 O
% O
of O
Denmark O

energy O
supply O
comes O
from O
fossil O
fuels B-TERM
, O
which O
are O
dramatically O

more O

any O

the O

of O

that O

something O

moreover B-TERM

, O

it O
will O
take O
some O

but O
make O
no O

: O
there O
is O
nothing B-TERM

about O

, O
the O
ingredients B-TERM

the O

lack B-TERM

, O

just O
as O
he O
dithered O

Hirohito O

Arafat O

thus O
the O

the O

ability O
to O
carry O
out O
its O

but O
, O
especially B-TERM
after O
the O

, O
we O
can O
value O
at O

. O

but O
the O
two B-TERM
sides O
remain O
deeply O

but O
what O
has O
been O
overlooked O
is O
that O
the O

there O
is O
also B-TERM
evidence O
that O

one O
of O

has O
resurfaced O
: O
how O
can O

this O

countries O
like B-TERM
Latvia O

have O
shown B-TERM
a O
willingness O
to O
do O
so O
. O

on O
June O
19 O
, O
after O
a O

work O
, O
the O
Parliamentary O
Commission O

laid O

his O
numerous O

never O

in O
his O

" O
Putin O
prefers O
to O

rather O

this O
is O
low O

hanging O
fruit B-TERM
that O

fifth O
, O
a O
global O
response B-TERM
to O
the O

, O
coordinated O
by O
the O
UN O

must O
accompany O

to O
be O
sure O
, O
there O
are O
many O
other O
things B-TERM
that O
are O
crucial O

so O
, O
when O

, O
they O
did O
not O
just O
relocate O
low O

offshored O

why O

it O

after O

what O
should O

one O
mystery B-TERM
is O
why O
Trump O
was O
so O
anxious O
to O
protect B-TERM
Flynn O

but O
it O
is O
also O
true O
that O
Iran O

emergence B-TERM
as O
the O
ninth O
nuclear O
power O
would O
provoke O
a O
regional B-TERM
and O
global O
upheaval O
, O
dangerously O
aggravate O
fears B-TERM

suspicions O
, O
and O
confront O
the O

with O
a O
profound O
crisis O
of O
vision O

the O
face O
of O
General O
Electric O

longtime O

Jack O
Welch O
is O
in O
bookstore O
windows O
across O
China O
, O
although O
his O
latest O
book O
is O
probably O
a O
pirated O
edition O
because O
China O
still O
has O
a O
way O
to O
go O
on O
copyright O
protection O
. O

if O
developing O
countries O
are O
left B-TERM
to O
their O
own O
devices O
, O
they O
will O
conclude O
that O
they O
should O
self O
- O
insure O
by O
rebuilding O
foreign B-TERM
- O
exchange O
reserves O
to O
even O
higher O
levels O
, O
a O
strategy O
that O
has O
clearly O
hurt O
global O
growth B-TERM

for O

, O
most O
government O
refugee O
shelters B-TERM
didn O
't O
provide O
gender O

exclusive O
toilets B-TERM
and O

- O
a O
disaster O
for O
women O
from O
conservative O
Islamic O
backgrounds O
. O

I O
assume O
that O
the O
reference O
to O
how O
a O
tipsy O
Khrushchev O
attempted B-TERM
to O
sign O
something O
by O
no O
means O
fits O
into O
the O
overall O
picture B-TERM
of O
human O
society O
. O

yes O
, O
apologists O
of O
outsourcing O
say O
, O
rich B-TERM
countries O
will O
lose O
low O
- O
skilled B-TERM
jobs O
in O
areas O
like B-TERM
textiles O
to O
low O
wage O
labor O
in O
China O
and O
elsewhere B-TERM
. O

consider B-TERM
unemployment O
, O
which O
in O
September O
stood O
at O
10.5 O
% O
, O
compared O
to O
only O
5 O
% O
in O
Germany O
. O

a O
common B-TERM
fiscal O
policy O
remains O
a O
distant O
dream B-TERM
, O
as O
does O
a O
genuine B-TERM
political O
union B-TERM
. O

even O
her O
resignation O
, O
25 O

this O

was O
spurred O
by O
a O
mutiny O
in O
her O
own O
cabinet B-TERM
and O
party O
. O

but O
Trump O
's O
several O
earlier O
efforts O
to O
steer O
prosecutors O
away O
from O
Flynn O
were O
strong B-TERM
signals O
that O
Flynn O
knows O
something O
that O
Trump O
desperately O
hopes O
that O

won O

find O
out O

for O

some O
of O

pressure O
, O
livestock O

switch O

they O
plan O
when O

where O
to O
strike O
. O

all O
ratings O
of O
financial O
products B-TERM
raise O
the O
same O
incentive O
problems B-TERM
and O
could O
benefit O
from O
reform B-TERM
. O

this O
year O
, O
Nigeria O

even O
paid O
the O
Chinese O

but O
for O
reform B-TERM
to O
succeed O
, O
a O
little O
old O
- O
fashioned O
solidarity O
extended O
Eastwards O
now O
is O
the O
best O
way B-TERM
to O
ensure O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
EU O

to O
European O
integration B-TERM
. O

individual O
variations O
in O
body O
fat O

, O
worryingly O
, O
disposition O
to O

, O
means B-TERM
that O
you O
cannot B-TERM
predict B-TERM
how O
much O
will O
affect O
any O
person O
at O
any O
time O
. O

because O
of O
Europe O
's O
multiplicity O
of O
languages O
, O
no O
one O
language O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
strong B-TERM
element O
of O
identity O
. O

unlike O
a O
century O
ago O
, O
when O
a O
rising O
Germany O
( O
which O
had O
surpassed O
Britain O
by O
1900 O
) O
stoked O
fears B-TERM
that O
helped B-TERM
precipitate O
the O
disaster B-TERM
of O
1914 O
, O
China O
is O
not O
about O
to O
pass O
us O
in O
overall O
power O
. O

but O
Ireland O
and O
Spain O
had O
budget O
surpluses O
and O
low O
debt O
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
which O
quickly O
turned O
into O
large O
deficits O
and O
high O
debt O
. O
so O
now O
European O
leaders B-TERM
say O
that O
it O
is O
the O
current B-TERM
- O
account O
deficits O
of O
the O
eurozone O

member O
countries O
that O
must O
be O
kept O
in O

so O
in O
Argentina O
big O
government O
deficits O
are O
a O
law O
of O
nature O
, O
a O
fact O
of O
life O
. O
hence O
Argentine O

can O
be O
low O

only O
for O

short O
periods O

the O

been O

rather O

called O

to O
answer B-TERM
that O
question O

it O
is O
important O
to O
distinguish O
between O

the O

the O

the O
combination O
of O
high O

makes O

a O
much O
less O

of O

there O

the O

problem O
that O
so O

unlike O

however O
, O
whoever O

will O
not O
necessarily B-TERM
inherit O

Europe O

they O

we O

the O

so O
the O

must O
be O
read O
from O

these O
are O

in O
the O

weak O
labor O

suggest O
that O
a O
fundamental O
re O

is O
in O

the O

declined O
sharply O
in O

, O
it O
might O
just O
be O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
before O
oil O

prices O
do O
the O

. O

on O
the O
most O
basic B-TERM
level O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
people O
of O
south O
Lebanon O
needed B-TERM
maps B-TERM
of O

Israel O
had O
laid O

, O
but O
these O
were O
never O
provided O
. O

if O
such O
a O
tripwire O
is O
really O
necessary B-TERM
, O
why O
shouldn O
't O
a O
reliable O
international O
force O
carry O
out O
that O
task O
? O

but O
its O
influence B-TERM
is O
more O
commercial O
than O
political O
. O

likewise O
, O
America O

corporate O
CEO O

and O
their O
near O

peers O
earn O
ten O
times O
more O

they O
did O
a O

now O
that O
the O
US O

- O
is O
beginning O
to O
deteriorate O

a O
military B-TERM
coup B-TERM
is O
not O
the O
only O
way B-TERM
to O
destroy O
a O
free B-TERM
society O
. O

because O
of O
its O
economic O
and O
trade O
muscle O
, O
China O
is O
bound O
to O
play O
a O
more O
prominent O
role B-TERM
as O
the O

of O

transparency B-TERM
alone B-TERM

this O

it O

show B-TERM
everyone O
how O
much O
the O

are O
getting B-TERM

who O

but O
that O
may O

changing O

on O
the O

, O
almost O
every O
nuclear O

is O
either B-TERM
expanding O

so O
if O
it O

the O
hukou O
system O
that O

the O

thus O
, O
to O
destroy O
the O

was O
not O
righting O
an O
old B-TERM
wrong O

perpetrating O
a O

one O

but O
if O
the O
human O
capacity O

knows O
few O
limits O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
start O
over O
again O
is O
just O
as O
remarkable O
. O

one O
explanation O
is O
that O
America O
is O
a O
more O

society O
where O
the O

are O
not O

and O
can O
seemingly O
get O

we O
run O
a O

" O

securing O

the O

a O

here O

the O

if O

what O
is O
uncanny O
about O
the O

the O

it O
displays O
continuity O

and O
despite O

this O
often B-TERM

it O
difficult B-TERM

this O

in O

a O

to O

without O

the O

so O
if O

ample O

the O

arose O
from O
the O

that O

could O
not O

the O

it O
is O
now O
widely O

that O
the O

, O
perhaps B-TERM
partly O
unconsciously O

embraced O
a O
deeply O
distorted O
image O
of O
al O

that O
portrayed O
it O

a O
hierarchical O
organization B-TERM
with O
a O
seamless O

- O
the O
prototype O
of O
a O
foe O
that O
the O
American O

could O
attack O

but O
the O
main B-TERM
reason O
is O
surely O
that O
Turkey O

indeed B-TERM

the O

here O
are O
a O
few O
lines O
of O
the O
kind O
of O

that O

uses B-TERM
: O

it O
can O
easily O
be O

some O
pointed O

no O

these O

for O

such O
fundamental O

may O
be O
a O

there O
are O
three O
problems B-TERM

this O
approach O

however O
, O
it O
will O
need O
to O

better O

increasing B-TERM
demand O

the O

virtually B-TERM
every O

to O
what O
the O

continue O

the O

that O

the O
key O
problem B-TERM
, O
which O

not O

so O
far O
, O
is O
that O
a O

indeed O

the O

indeed B-TERM

in O

but O
Armstrong O

is O
about O
more O
than O
data B-TERM

let B-TERM
me O
first O
set O
the O
scene O
by O
making O
three O
observations O
on O
where O
we O
are O
today O
. O
first O
, O
in O
the O
advanced O
countries O
, O
we O
have O
probably O
seen B-TERM
the O
worst O
of O
the O
financial O
crisis O
. O

the O
predictable O
suspect O
is O
former B-TERM
Colombian O
president O
Álvaro O
Uribe O
. O

among O
other O
things O
, O
Trump O
has O
threatened O
a O
trade O
war B-TERM
with O
China O
and O
Mexico O
, O
and O
says O
he O
would O
renegotiate O
America O
's O
existing O
trade O
agreements B-TERM
. O

if O
this O
last O
is O
true O
, O
it O
will O
help O
confirm O
Serb O
suspicions O
that O
the O
Hague O
process O
stinks O
of O
politics O
. O

how O
can O
such O
" O
social O
accounting O
" O
be O
done O
? O

although B-TERM
a O
compromise O
solution O
was O
provisionally O
accepted O
, O
its O
message O
is O
weak B-TERM
and O
obscure O
. O

millions O
die O
each O
year O
of O
poverty O
- O
lives O
that O
could O
be O
saved O
if O
the O
poor O
had O
access O
to O
better O
health O
care O
, O
nutrition O
, O
and O
other O
essential O
needs O
. O

it O
requires O
plausible O
leadership B-TERM
and O
the O
reasonable O
hope O
that O
things O
will O
get O
better O
before O
long O
. O

the O
EU O
cannot O
simply O
proclaim O
" O
solidarity O
" O
as O
a O
core O
value B-TERM
and O
then O
do O
nothing B-TERM
to O
foster O
it O
among B-TERM
those O
who O
feel B-TERM
marginalized O
. O

is O
the O
Market O
Moral O
? O

so O
here O
is O
the O
second O
paradox O
: O
both O
large O
and O
small O
EU O
countries O
imagine O
that O
they O
can O
optimize O
their O
relative O
leverage O
by O
adopting O
inter O
- O
governmentalist O
positions O
. O

According O
to O
legends O
, O
this O
is O
where O
Noah O

here O

over O
the O
past O

, O
I O
have O
given O

the O
key O

the O
answer B-TERM
lies O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
the O

now O
that O
it O

the O

aim B-TERM

are O

for O
example O
, O
the O
current B-TERM
story O
in O
Colombia O
appears O
to O
be O
that O

the O
worry O
is O
that O
, O
at O

in O

the O
IMF O

the O

the O

the O

considered B-TERM
the O
most O
modern B-TERM
among B-TERM
the O

, O
because O

that O

because O
the O

but O
the O
only O
real O
test O
of O
UN O

is O
whether O

the O

indeed O

Mr. O

therefore O

it O

but O
, O
from O
an O

from O
the O

the O

the O
decision B-TERM

the O
main O
issue O

the O

felt O
to O

, O
somehow O
met O
its O
Waterloo O
in O
2005 O
, O
when O

the O

, O

George O

these O

another B-TERM
important B-TERM
consideration O
is O
the O
considerable B-TERM

another O
positive O
consequence B-TERM
is O
the O
demonstrated O

George O

an O

two B-TERM
major O
forces O
: O
the O
super O

in O
the O

, O
if O
you O

that O
the O
way B-TERM

your O

rich O
was O
by O

your O

giving O
it O

, O
you O
would O
earn O
very O
few O

such O
a O
tendency O
can O
contribute O

a O
further O
weakening O

deepening O
of O

the O

Another O
problem B-TERM
is O
that O

can O
be O
a O

for O

the O

in O
Montreal O
- O
the O
11th O
such O
meeting O
- O
should O
look O
beyond O

, O
so O
that O
the O

gets O
onto O
a O
safe O

long O

companies O

, O
to O
cope O
with O
the O

the O
result B-TERM
will O
be O
more O
liquid O

stable B-TERM
financial O

, O
in O
turn O
making O
the O

But O
this O
has O
already O
become O
a O
Europe O

wide O

. O

second O
, O
and O
more O
difficult B-TERM
, O
the O
oil O
sheikhs O

other O
producers O
of O

must O
be O
talked O

, O
better O
yet O
, O
not O
to O

so O
who O
's O
right O
in O
this O
debate O
which O
has O
spilled O
into O
the O
streets O
of O
Seattle O

Washington O

now O
Prague O
, O
during O
the O
cycle O
of O
international O

meetings O
in O
the O

so O
, O
what O
if O
Europe O

the O
US O
both O
enter O
a O
phase O
of O
prolonged B-TERM
budgetary O
adjustment O
while O
the O
emerging O

stays O
on O

? O

often B-TERM
, O
they O
want B-TERM
change B-TERM
- O
just O
that O
. O

Tanzania O
and O
countries O
in O
similar B-TERM
situations B-TERM
must O
demonstrate O
their O
commitment O
to O
women O

by O
eliminating O
systematic O

. O

America O
looks B-TERM
set O
to O
enter O
into O
a O

driven O
by O
a O
slowdown O
in O
business O

. O

a O
final B-TERM
word O
to O
the O
victims O
. O

so O
they O
learned O
to O
be O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
opportunities O
in O
underserved O
markets O
, O
working O
as O
peddlers O
, O
for O

, O
or O
creating O
new O

, O
or O
new O

if O
the O
Kim O

really O
wants B-TERM
an O
opportunity O
to O
join O
the O
international O

, O
it O
has O
everything O
it O
needs B-TERM
, O
written O
, O
agreed O

and O
ready O
to O
be O
implemented O

and O
the O
summit O
in O
Abu O

has O
provided O
a O
clear O
plan B-TERM
to O
get O
there O
by O
2018 O
- O
a O
strategy O
that O
complements O
other O

to O
raise O

such O

I O
reply O
emphatically O
that O
it O
is O
not O
. O

the O
best O
option O
is O
to O
work O
more O
closely O
with O
Kurdish O

in O
both O
Iraq O

contrary O
to O

can O
be O
achieved O

can O
the O

obviously B-TERM

the O

for O

proportional O

: O
